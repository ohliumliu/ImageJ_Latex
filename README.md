This plugin can convert a Latex expression and generate an image from www.texify.com. 
It allows the user to specify the final size of the equation and whether to insert 
the equation into any open image window. The equation is inserted to the target window
and automatically selected for further operation, such as moving with the arrow keys.

This module is built with Netbeans as a Maven project.

Download ImageJ_Latex-x.x.x.jar to the plugins folder, or subfolder, restart ImageJ or refresh menu,
and there should be a new plugin called "ImageJ Latex".
