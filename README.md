This plugin can parse a Latex expression and generate an image with the help of an online Latex equation editor http://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php.

It allows the user to specify the final resolution and size of the equation and whether to insert 
the equation into any existing image window. The equation is inserted to the target window
and automatically selected for further operation, such as moving with the arrow keys.

This module is built with Netbeans as a Maven project.

One would check out this repository and build it locally to get the executable jar file, which is then copied to the plugins folder of Fiji/ImageJ. Still the source java file can be compiled within ImageJ. 

Fiji recommends using its convenient updater to manage plugins. The update site is http://sites.imagej.net/Yul.liuyu/. Fiji has good documentation on how to use and contribute to update sites http://fiji.sc/List_of_update_sites.
